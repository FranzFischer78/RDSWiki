# Linux: Installing your server

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are not experienced with linux we HIGHLY recommend you to simply get a server on [BisectHosting](https://www.bisecthosting.com/raft?r=rdswiki), you'll be able to get your server running within minutes and with their one-click install you'll save a ton of time and money.

RDS can run on both GUI based (with a desktop user interface ) and CLI based (with only a command line to work with ) distros. It will work also on distros that aren't Debian based, though the steps will need to be altered:
